# Bookforge Blueprint

## Project summary

Bookforge is a hybrid **C++20 + Python** market microstructure project centered on a low-latency limit order book, historical market replay, feature extraction, and short-horizon signal research.

The long-term goal is to build a repo that demonstrates strength across:

- **systems engineering**
- **market microstructure modeling**
- **historical replay infrastructure**
- **feature engineering + ML research**
- **clear documentation, testing, and interview readiness**

This is not just an order book project. It is gradually becoming a small **market replay and research platform**.

---

## North-star objectives

- Build a clean **price-time priority limit order book** in C++.
- Support **historical replay** from external market data sources.
- Create an adapter boundary between **exchange-specific data** and **internal engine actions**.
- Export microstructure features for downstream research.
- Build a Python layer for liquidity estimation and short-horizon prediction.
- Provide a lightweight demo surface through an API and dashboard.
- Make the codebase polished enough for strong discussion in **quant SWE / quant research interviews**.

---

## Architecture pillars

### 1. Core engine
The core engine is responsible for:
- order representation
- price levels
- price-time priority
- insertion, cancellation, execution
- best bid / ask access
- spread and mid-price queries
- deterministic internal state transitions

### 2. Replay and data adapters
The replay layer is responsible for:
- loading historical datasets
- normalizing raw exchange fields
- mapping external events into internal engine-facing actions
- replaying events in deterministic order
- optionally validating replay results against reference snapshots

### 3. Feature extraction
The feature layer is responsible for:
- spread and mid-price tracking
- top-of-book and multi-level depth metrics
- order flow imbalance
- depth imbalance
- rolling liquidity measures
- feature export for Python workflows

### 4. Research layer
The research layer is responsible for:
- data cleaning and labeling
- liquidity estimation
- ML training and validation
- explainability and error analysis
- experiment logging and reproducibility

### 5. Demo and product surface
The demo layer is responsible for:
- exposing replay / feature outputs via API
- visualizing book state and metrics
- showing research outputs in a simple dashboard
- making the repo easier to understand and demo live

---

## Current direction

The original plan focused mainly on **LOBSTER-style replay**. The project now also includes an early **Hyperliquid historical replay path**, which means the architecture should support more than one data source.

This changes the design emphasis:

- not just “load one dataset,”
- but “define a reusable replay abstraction that can support multiple providers.”

Near-term design principle:
- **raw dataset -> normalization -> external event model -> engine adapter -> internal engine**

## Suggested implementation order right now

Priority order for the next few steps:

1. Stabilize the current replay files and adapter structure.
2. Plug the adapter into the real matching engine interface.
3. Add replay-focused tests.
4. Define snapshot output.
5. Start feature extraction from replayed book state.
6. Revisit Python bindings only after the replay/core path feels stable.

---

## Definition of success

Bookforge will feel “high level” when it can do the following:

- replay a historical sample deterministically,
- map raw market data into a clean internal engine interface,
- maintain a correct order-book state,
- export useful microstructure features,
- support a reproducible Python research workflow,
- and present the system clearly through tests, docs, and a small demo.

At that point, it becomes a strong portfolio project not just as an order book, but as a compact **market microstructure research platform**.
